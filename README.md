## About me
Hi! I'm Maria, 26 years old and from Norway. At the time of writing I am studiying front-end development, but in a few weeks I'll be working as a developer. Very exciting! I'll soon have an associate's degree in front-end development, and I have a bachelor's degree in Informatics: design, use, interaction.

The work on my GitHub profile displays the journey I have had learning front-end. Though design is not my strongest suit, I've done my best during the projects we've had through the front-end studies.
